#  Distance is a continuous variable measured in kilometers. Car availability (alltime/not all time) and weather (fair/bad) are dummy variables.
# Car availability means, whether the student has the possibility of travelling to school by car. Car availability equals 1, if the student has the possibility of commuting to school by car every day.

    #This analysis studies whether consumers are willing to pay more for sustainable beer and what predicts consumers’ willingness-to-pay (WTP).

    #The dependent variable is the amount per ounce that a respondent would be willing to pay above the typical price of his/her favorite beer.
    #Regression results with dependent variable WTP for sustainable beer (in $/oz). is $/oz is more sustainable
    #We include several categories of independent variables,
    #For each additional $1.00 that one pays per ounce of beer, an individual is willing to pay a premium of 7.4 cents per ounce for the sustainable version.
    #Personal demographics only account for about 9% of the R-squared decomposition and, as
#a variable grouping are statistically insignificant. Those who are younger and those with lower levels of education are willing to pay more for sustainable beer. Contrary to other studies’ findings about the importance of children or location of residence, we find no evidence that these conditions matter.
